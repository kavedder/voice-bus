\section{Introduction}
This project is a voice- and DTMF-interactive bus schedule service, which serves up information from OneBusAway \cite{oba} and StopInfo \cite{stopinfo}. It is a completely system-initiative system, but implicitly saves actions in a user database for quick access in subsequent calls. It is designed for quick and efficient use while mobile, but offers the ability to retrieve unlimited bus arrival information within the same interaction, as well as retrieve all known non-schedule-related information about a particular stop.
